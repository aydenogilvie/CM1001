        <p> Current Projects I am undertaking is being the Social Media Representive for RGU Kickboxing, making posts for the club to inform followers to give the club a better online presence.
          With a greater online presence it is allowing us to move in a more professional image for the club and grow from our current sponsors to allow us to fund more activities for the club.

         <h2>Who wants To Be a Millionare</h2>
        <p>My main past pervious project was from my Advanced Higher Computing Sience Coursework, which I developed my own, Who Wants To Be a Millionaire game. It was written in HTML and used PHP to grab questions from a database stored online. The site also had an admin panel and login which allowed users to add or remove quiz questions. The courseowkr took me 2 months in total but is something I am most proud of!<p>
