          <h1>PERSONAL STATEMENT</h1>
          <p>I’m an extremely motivated individual. I have a passion for success in any activity or position I am placed in allowing me to achieve grade 7 in acoustic guitar.
           I also demonstrated the fundamental characteristics of being a natural leader  by past and current experiences which I am being or have been faced with in life,
           for example taking charge of boosting my rugby’s teams moral when we have a large deficit in points to reclaim and in some cases enabling us to claw back the points
           because of this moral boost. Another example of this would also of been when I developed a piece of computing software to manage my time and help me structure a routine
           behind me for day to day life, also this program being what I submitted as my Advanced Higher Computing project. These experiences have taught me how to work in a group with others
           but also to take criticism and build from it to achieve a set goal. I have people skills from my time spent working at my last job at a church center in my local village (Kemnay).
